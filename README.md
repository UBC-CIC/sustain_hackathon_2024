## Introduction

**About Sustainability, Generative AI, and Cloud Computing** <br>
Sustainability is defined by responsible resource use to ensure long-term benefits for future generations while fostering respect for the planet and all its inhabitants. It emphasizes the integration of ecological, social, and economic well-being to create healthy, resilient communities that can thrive in harmony with their environment. This holistic approach seeks not only to prevent harm but to actively improve the natural and human systems we depend on. <br>
Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence designed to generate new content, data, or outputs that are not explicitly programmed in advance. It involves models that can create new examples or samples within a given domain, such as images, text, music, or other types of data. <br>
Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. It allows you to focus on developing, rather than having to worry about providing all the hardware. One of the biggest cloud service providers out there is AWS
